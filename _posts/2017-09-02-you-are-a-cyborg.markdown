(Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a cyber augmented super human? You could run faster, jump higher, hell you could even learn faster. I know I have.)

Ever since watching the 1995 animated film Ghost in The Shell, I have had this fascination with the subject. It wasn’t so much the physical element that intrigued me, but the idea of having a cyberbrain. Being able to have your brain able to instantly connect with a cloud network comes with so many interesting possibilities on its own. You could instantly access any information you wanted and digitally communicate with anyone remotely. Sound familiar? That's because we already can. We’ve already experienced cyborg augmentation in the form of an external device.

While interacting with my iphone I couldn’t help but think of how much people take such a device for granted. I have access to the entirety of the internet in the palms of my hands. I can communicate with someone I don’t even know halfway across the globe. If I don’t know the answer to a question or problem, I can find it within seconds with a simple google search. In a sense, I have more power than anyone in the world did twenty years ago.

But it's not just the utility it brings, it's our reliance on the technology to function. If you take away someone's smartphone, it greatly reduces a person’s ability to function. I rely on it so much that I still can’t get to some places without using gps. Not to mention the technology addiction which has become a problem within the United States. It's almost become an involuntary part of ourselves.

Still, I can’t find any downside strong enough to have me part with the tech. It just makes things well, easier.

It’s a long way from invasive brain implants, but with all of the development in wearable tech like google glass, I can’t help but wonder how long it will be before we get there.
