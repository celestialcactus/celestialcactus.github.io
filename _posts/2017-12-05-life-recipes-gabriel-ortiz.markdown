**Tell me about yourself Gabe, specifically, how do you go about making food for yourself on an average day?**

My favorite shad of blue is ultra-marine—it’s bold. I don’t know if I had a childhood, which might make me a robot or something. Food… I get out supplies, like I set the plates and stuff. I start choppin’ my veggies or whatever, or get the rice cooker goin’ if I’m doin’ that, or like cut chicken and start the noodles if I’m eating Asian.

**Is that your favorite style?**

Yea, and I clean as I go so I’m not making messes, and I like to time things out so I can start another thing at the same time.

**And what’s your end goal?**

Dig into that shit.

**Yes**
