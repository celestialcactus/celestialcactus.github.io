Aint healthcare a bitch? And this is coming from someone like me with nearly full coverage. Someone who gets to enjoy every perk of the already god awful medical industry in this country without having to worry if my family is going to be able to afford to put food on the table. And you know what? It’s still terrible! I’ve been having back and neck pain for the past two years, and have spent loads and loads of money trying to remedy a condition that everyone knows F@#k all about! Welp, it aint polymyositis. It aint lupus. Here, take a few more blood tests that you’ll also have to pay for and come back next week. Rinse and repeat this for a couple years and you’ll find that you’ve already spent a couple thousand on healthcare and are still at square one. And this is provided that you’ve got coverage. If you don’t well, you can quintuple those expenses and expect your children to starve while your doctors shrug their shoulders and send you off with a recommendation of some expensive drugs that won’t work. But I guess that’s the way it works. Which is why I’m glad that I’m not the only one thinking about it! Healthcare should come as a right to those who are citizens. Sure, some people are going to abuse the system. But as stated in the article, people also abuse good highways and roads. Everyone pays for them, but we don’t discriminate against who gets to drive on them! Great article! I’m glad to see that some people get it.

The year is 1978. It’s a new age of terror and warfare that requires a new breed of badass willing to go step over the line. Meet Tom Cruise. A man who is willing to go to every extent to save his acting career from obscurity. Played by the man himself Tom Cruise. When Tom Cruise is met by a secret casting agent to do some cool acting stuff, he is faced with the ride of his life. And you better bet your bottom dollar that he’s there to kick some ass and chew bubblegum, but he’s all out of gum… Implying that he’s only there to kick some ass.

Seriously though. Before this article, I didn’t expect to see much from a supposedly “historical” blockbuster. A thriller inspired by the C.I.A drug running brush wars in the 80’s? Starring Tom Cruise? Yeah, I’ll pass.

I mean, sure it isn’t gonna be accurate. Sure, it’s not going to hit those points that it should. Otherwise we would be watching a history channel doc. (And we know where they’ve been headed for a while.)

It’s Hollywood, what can you expect?

Frankly I’m just surprised that they went as far as to ruin Tom’s shit eating grin on screen! Honestly, from the title, I thought this article that this movie was going to be garbage. But towards the end of it, it’s kind of relieving to see that at least some historical semblance is shown in the flick.

I was kind of on the fence about watching this movie. But now I’m actually curious to see some of the redeeming points mentioned.
