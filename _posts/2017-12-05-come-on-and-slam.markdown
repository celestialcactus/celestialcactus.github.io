I’ll be the first to say it. Poetry slams aren’t my cup of tea.

Coming from an arts magnet school, my idea of a poetry slam spawns itself as a gaggle of angsty teen tumblrites plaintively crying “no one understands me”. With a few exceptions from genuinely talented writers, this was what I actually experienced from my high school student poetry exhibitions. So, when I heard of this event, I naturally wasn’t too enthusiastic.

I was like an aloof traveler unwittingly stepping into a dragon’s lair. I say that because I was genuinely surprised by what I would witness. Each poet unleashed a verbal barrage after verbal barrage, each individually loaded with wit, humor, and visceral description. It was chilling at first, hearing skilled writers perform like this. But as they continued, I gradually warmed up. I was enjoying it all. I even found myself shouting with them. They were straight up spitting fire.

Of all of the poems I heard there was one that really caught my attention. It was one in which the poet Vanessa discussed her identity as an Afro-Latina, and how it plays a part in her life. She talked about how she struggled to find her identity in a world that throws out any sense of cultural nuance, always labeling her and forcing her to choose.

As a Puerto Rican who grew up in a predominantly white town I really feel this sentiment. I’ve often been called “gringito” for the way I speak, and never can truly feel like I am a part of my own culture. I was also never able to feel truly comfortably among a sea of white. While I found my place growing up in this small Italian run town, I always felt different because of the color of my skin. Never Rican enough, and never white enough. That’s how it was, and still is for me.

Going to this event gave me a lot of perspective, both within poetry and the topics that were brought up. I discovered a lot about the poet’s lives, and discovered a lot about myself as well.
