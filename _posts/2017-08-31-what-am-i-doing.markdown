So, the internet is a thing and digital media is booming! That should be great for someone like me who wants to work in media right? Well, not quite.

The reasoning lies more in my own (internal) creative struggle. When I browsed the internet today I noticed the saturation of media. Like it's everywhere. Log on to Facebook and your entire screen is filled with all kinds of content. Donâ€™t even get me started about Youtube. 

The web provides a great way to access content. However, as web media becomes more saturated and commercialized, it makes it difficult for people starting up to enter. It also provokes some of the bigger players to come in and start buying everyone out. And for someone who wants to start their own media company or property thats a problem.

I went into digital media because of the creative freedom the web allows. I just want the web to stay that way.
