And I can’t stop listening to them…

Some months ago, I was experiencing my annual musical exploration kick. I liken it to a weekend rum tasting of sorts. A collection of the finest aural flavors I could crowdsource and research in a week's time, lined up in neat rows ready to be savored and critiqued. This year's tasting was a little underwhelming.  

I had just recently come off of the Doom 2016 Video Game Soundtrack composed by Mick Gordon. Its impressive blend of heavy multi-processed analog synth tones and down-tuned guitar riffs. I was still craving something heavy hitting, unique, and genre-breaking as Mick’s soundtrack.

I had already drunk a glass of Bacardi beforehand, and now all I wanted to do was get lit.

I was about to give up and just down the rest of the bottle, a decision that most binge drinkers regret when they're leaned over the toilet extruding their insides at projectile velocity.
(Drink responsibly kids.)

That was when my friend approached me with a late recommendation. A bottle labeled Death Grips: Bottomless Pit. He approached me and said, “Yo you gotta listen to these guys, like they're maaaad crazy but it's something that you would probably into”.

Maaaaaad crazy huh? I liked the sound of that.

So I said, “Eh, sure I’ll have a listen”. I plugged in and strapped down, ready to experience this mad crazy for myself.

If Mick Gordon's Doom soundtrack was a glass of Bacardi, Death Grips was an oddly mixed Molotov cocktail.

For those of you who are new to this banger of a party, Death Grips is a Sacramento based experimental hip-hop trio, featuring rapper/vocalist MC Ride, Zach Hill on drums, and Andy Morin on production and bass guitar. They're most known for their unconventional musical style and genre-bending tracks that have been influential in steering the direction of modern hip-hop. MC Rides aggressive vocal delivery accentuates the group's raw energy both in the studio and on stage, and in my opinion, serves to be the most important ingredient to this hell of a concoction.

The first track that I had the pleasure of listening to was Death Grips’ “Hot head”. The track opened up with some arpeggiated analog style synths. Not a bad start to a track. I tend to enjoy synthesizers, and it had been a while since I heard any kind of rap or hip-hop with electronic influences. I wasn’t ready for what I was about to hear next. I was met with a violent bombardment of downsampled percussion and incoherent gibberish. A few seconds later and the bombardment intensified. It sounded like a group of metal, free jazz, and punk drummers decided to have a musical orgy, and the gibberish now sounded more akin to a dog barking into a microphone.

My ears were asking me “lol wtf is this, unplug please”. I ended up going home and listening to more of their material. To my confusion, there happened to be a significant cult fan-base following them. At first, I thought they were just a meme circulated by music forums.

It took a while to get adjusted to the new sound. But after a few listens over their work I began discovering the actual appeal behind Death Grips, and actually began to enjoy their tracks. I began loving every crazy second of it that I heard and even found meaning in their music. 

This can be found on tracks like “I’ve Seen Footage”, in which MC Ride talks about how he has not only become desensitized by his past trauma but also as a result of the mass amounts of disturbing media online. I find this track meaning to be extremely culturally relevant, considering that the topic of trauma has been overlooked when it comes to media. I myself have found myself witness to traumatizing events right in front of me, and not batting an eye due to the imagery I have experienced second hand. This same type of unfiltered substance can be found in many other tracks as well, offering not just a unique sound to their artistry, but bold commentary as well.

Death Grips has become one of my favorite listens of all time, offering a unique flavor of artistry through their performance, musical sound, and lyricism. It isn’t often that I go for second or third rounds, so I definitely would recommend giving them a taste. Who knows, maybe you’ll find that Death Grips your tongue too.
