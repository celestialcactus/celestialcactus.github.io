I"¢<p>(Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a cyber augmented super human? You could run faster, jump higher, hell you could even learn faster. I know I have.)</p>

<p>Ever since watching the 1995 animated film Ghost in The Shell, I have had this fascination with the subject. It wasnâ€™t so much the physical element that intrigued me, but the idea of having a cyberbrain. Being able to have your brain able to instantly connect with a cloud network comes with so many interesting possibilities on its own. You could instantly access any information you wanted and digitally communicate with anyone remotely. Sound familiar? Thatâ€™s because we already can. Weâ€™ve already experienced cyborg augmentation in the form of an external device.</p>

<p>While interacting with my iphone I couldnâ€™t help but think of how much people take such a device for granted. I have access to the entirety of the internet in the palms of my hands. I can communicate with someone I donâ€™t even know halfway across the globe. If I donâ€™t know the answer to a question or problem, I can find it within seconds with a simple google search. In a sense, I have more power than anyone in the world did twenty years ago.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s not just the utility it brings, itâ€™s our reliance on the technology to function. If you take away someoneâ€™s smartphone, it greatly reduces a personâ€™s ability to function. I rely on it so much that I still canâ€™t get to some places without using gps. Not to mention the technology addiction which has become a problem within the United States. Itâ€™s almost become an involuntary part of ourselves.</p>

<p>Still, I canâ€™t find any downside strong enough to have me part with the tech. It just makes things well, easier.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a long way from invasive brain implants, but with all of the development in wearable tech like google glass, I canâ€™t help but wonder how long it will be before we get there.</p>
