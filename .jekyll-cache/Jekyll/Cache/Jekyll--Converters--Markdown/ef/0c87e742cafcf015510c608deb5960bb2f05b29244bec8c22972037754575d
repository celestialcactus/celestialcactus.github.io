I"È<p>Aint healthcare a bitch? And this is coming from someone like me with nearly full coverage. Someone who gets to enjoy every perk of the already god awful medical industry in this country without having to worry if my family is going to be able to afford to put food on the table. And you know what? Itâ€™s still terrible! Iâ€™ve been having back and neck pain for the past two years, and have spent loads and loads of money trying to remedy a condition that everyone knows F@#k all about! Welp, it aint polymyositis. It aint lupus. Here, take a few more blood tests that youâ€™ll also have to pay for and come back next week. Rinse and repeat this for a couple years and youâ€™ll find that youâ€™ve already spent a couple thousand on healthcare and are still at square one. And this is provided that youâ€™ve got coverage. If you donâ€™t well, you can quintuple those expenses and expect your children to starve while your doctors shrug their shoulders and send you off with a recommendation of some expensive drugs that wonâ€™t work. But I guess thatâ€™s the way it works. Which is why Iâ€™m glad that Iâ€™m not the only one thinking about it! Healthcare should come as a right to those who are citizens. Sure, some people are going to abuse the system. But as stated in the article, people also abuse good highways and roads. Everyone pays for them, but we donâ€™t discriminate against who gets to drive on them! Great article! Iâ€™m glad to see that some people get it.</p>
