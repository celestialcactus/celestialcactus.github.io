project: Stamford Innovation Week Digital Experience
year: 2019
category: Digital Experience, Design, Marketing
synopsis: I was brought on to work with Stamford Innovation Week (a week long cultural event series centered around innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship) to expand their digital presence. Over the course of a few months, I expanded the organization's marketing efforts, built out web experiences, and developed process workflows which contributed to the events success and growth.
features:
    - header: "Process: Marketing Strategy"
      descrip:
      - line: From the start, SiWeek made it clear that they had set ambitious growth goals for its second year in action. Their primary objectives were to increase web traffic, SiWeek email subscribers, and event attendance by 20 - 50%. This meant that I would need to prioritize improving our lead generation in addition to reconverting previous events attendees. I worked with the SiWeek team to develop a multichannel marketing strategy composed of on-location media activations, social media, and email marketing. 
    - header: "Developing Personas"
      descrip: 
      - line: One challenge with developing SiWeeks marketing plan was that its programming created a broadly defined set of demographic information. Each event had its own intended audience which could be in different life stages or professions. When creating a marketing plan it’s important to define our targets so we can understand how our work impacts our audience.
      - line: I started off by answering three questions.  
      - line: Who?
      - line: Knowing who I’m communicating with helps me deliver my message more effectively through understanding who they are as a person and what they value most. 
      - line: Why?
      - line: Understanding the why answers two things. Why is our message important to them? Does it help them obtain something that they consider valuable? 
      - line: Where?
      - line: Identifying where a person digitally or physically resides helps establish the context in which they receive a message. For example, a growing professional would be more likely to use linkedin as a means of professional development, networking, and discovery. So, it would make sense that we serve them content related to what they were already looking for in that context. 
      - line: By answering these three questions, we would be able focus our efforts effectively towards driving outcomes.
      - line: To help with identifying our core audiences, I created a series of temporary personas using HubSpot customer data, social media analytics, and qualitative interviews.

    - header: "Customer Journey"
      descrip: 
      - line: With so many moving parts across workstreams, it could be easy to become entrenched in a process and lose sight of the bigger picture. Additionally, without having any established measurements, it would be nearly impossible to evaluate whether the work we were doing had any impact at all. As a means of keeping track of all of our touchpoints, I created a generalized customer journey outline. By defining the touchpoints between us and our customers, we could get a clearer picture of how our efforts contributed to their experience. 
      - line: Then us ing a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, I would be able to evaluate each stage in the customer journey and look for opportunities to improve.
      - line: For example, using HubSpot registration data I was able to observe a customer's interactions from the moment they became a lead, to the moment they made a purchase. By measuring each interaction I could make informed adjustments to touchpoints, whether it be a web oriented process or even changing our sales pitch at media activations.
      - line: The result was an increase in lead generation and conversions through each iteration of our journey.

  - header: "Process: Experience Design and Prototyping"
      descrip:
      - line: The SiWeek team wanted the website to operate as a centralized content hub for any prospective event goers. Site users would come here to learn more about events, register, and make other purchases. With these goals in mind, I needed to emphasize usability and navigation while balancing other page requirements from multiple stakeholders.

  - header: "Cognitive Walkthroughs" 
      descrip:
      - line: To help facilitate the design process, I conducted several cognitive walkthroughs of the initial page design. These exercises are a great way to get insight on how a user might feel about the experience in real time and helps validate (or invalidate) any assumptions that I might have had early on in the process. Once I finished synthesizing the information collected, I could get to revising the prototyped page and add new features. The resulting outcome from these iterative exercises was an overall improved functionality across the page including streamlined content submission systems, better readability, and search filtering.

  - header: "Process: Workflow Design and Automation"
      descrip:
      - line: In addition to web and strategy, I worked on managing SiWeek’s HubSpot system, creating content, and automating email workflows. During this time, I wanted to find a way of reducing churn rate while maximizing engagement and buyer outcomes. For this to happen we would need to improve our audience targeting and work towards greater content personalization. 
      - line: Our biggest challenge was that our existing framework could not allow this to happen at scale. For example, if I wanted to create a cross sell campaign between events, I would need to manually draft an email for every buyer permutation possible out of 25 events. Then I would need to create individual automation workflows for each of these permutations.
      - line: As a solution, I ended up developing a new framework which utilized integrated user data streams and tokenization features to provide the automation possible for content to be created at scale. 
      - line: Here’s some workflow documentation I created outlining the process.

  - header: "Challenges and Success"
      descrip: 
      - line: This project came with a number of challenges that I learned to overcome. In its second year, SiWeek had still yet to establish workstream processes which affected the flow of communication and project delivery itself. In addition (like many organizations of the same type), information was always subject to change at any moment. This motivated me to put great effort into working cross functionally between team members and establishing my own sets of processes that would make it possible to meet milestones in the project timeline. 
      - line: It also gave me the opportunity to reinforce and test models I had developed in previous projects. Sometimes models (whether it be learned through theory or or practiced through experience) don't always work in novel settings. However, these new circumstances give the opportunity to apply new tool sets and skills, so the next time I face a challenge I have a better set of cards at my disposal. 
      - line: Despite the challenges, I was successful in the development and implementation of SiWeek’s digital strategy, which contributed to a 127% increase in lead generation and a 163% increase in events attendance from last year. This success has set SiWeek’s growth goals on track for this year and beyond. 
      - line: We also received great feedback from the local press, our events attendees, and our organization partners. Here you can even see IBM Master Inventor Niel Sahota repping our T-Shirts in one of his personal vlogs.
