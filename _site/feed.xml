In just forty eight hours, these creatives will have worked tirelessly around the clock to bring their ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Global Game Jam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I had the pleasure to participate in the worldwide event at the Ferguson Library in Stamford Connecticut. This year would be my second time attending the event, but by no means will it be the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with some familiar faces, and a fair share of new ones I would embark on one of the most creatively refreshing weekends I have had in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does the Game Jam work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a weekend, teams will group together to develop a game based around a set theme. This encourages groups to start from scratch in order to have their game fit the theme, rather than rely on previous assets or builds. At the end of the day on Sunday, all hands would come off their tools and the games would be judged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds fun right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell yeah it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am nowhere close to being a developer. At least when it comes to working with any kind of code or programming. The most I can do is a little bit of drawing, writing, and music. But this is one of the amazing things about the Game Jam. You don’t have to be a programming wizard to have fun. You will always walk into an event and find friendly faces who are willing to work with whatever skillset you have to make a game. As long as you are willing to learn and collaborate you will always feel at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team Vortex would be my home for the second year in a row. What first occurred as a joke referencing the inept pokemon villains and their goofy team names would become the permanent name for our dev group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gamejam-1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; max-width: 350px; margin: 0 0 15px 15px;&quot; /&gt; And we were back to kick some ass and chew bubblegum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we were all out of bubblegum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the announcement for the theme came through we immediately got the ideas rolling. This years theme was “Transmission”. We first started with a “pandemic” style game where the player would work to create the ultimate STD and spread it across the country. The player would select different traits and have the disease evolve, and eventually infect every teenager in America in some of the grossest gameplay possible.
Of course it isn’t hard to see why we couldn’t just roll with the idea at a very much family friendly event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to think of the children…. We had to come up with a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually after twenty or so game ideas we had something. We settled on the marriage of two concepts that had the potential for some interesting platforming gameplay and narrative substance. One idea would have the player control a carrier pigeon trying to deliver a message from one person to another while evading various obstacles along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other idea involved a courier in the first world war running across the battlefield delivering messages and picking up letters from soldiers in the trenches. The story would revolve around the letters that the soldiers wrote, many of them being their dying words to their loved ones. Pretty dark, but appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gamejam-2.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; max-width: 350px; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;&quot; /&gt; So we decided that the carrier pigeon would be a playable character in a World War 1 themed game and got rolling on the darkly themed narrative which would be aptly named “Courier”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initial idea would inspire the first track that I made for the game. A simple drone piece that would carry the tension experienced in the trenches and beyond. No heroic trumpets blaring, no tragic strings. Just a dark tone underneath the screams of men and incoming mortar fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the rest of the project differed from the tracks tone. The art style was more lighthearted and cartoony, and the gameplay was extremely fast paced and jumpy. This called for drawing it back a bit. At least so the entire game didn’t sound like a horror movie while looking like an E rated platformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I was happy with how the Game Jam went. The team worked to create a by far better end product than last years. I also ended up composing a number of orchestral tracks for the game, venturing into a genre of music I wasn’t used to making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game can be downloaded and played here:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/courier-0&quot;&gt;https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/courier-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack will be available soon as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Every year game developers around the world come together to collaborate and create in the worlds largest game dev event.

&lt;p&gt;…Engaging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the deal with this Player Unknown Battlegrounds game that everyone’s been raving on about? That’s the question that I would continuously ask myself while watching the development of what would now be an industry disrupting heavy hitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds (more popularly known as PUBG) released a few months ago under the radar under early access on Steam. For reference, early access enables game developers to release their a very much “work in progress” copy of their game to the market. In the past, this method of financing has led to cash grab game development, broken promises, and the anguished cries of thousands of frustrated gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when I heard about PUBG for the first time, I wasn’t impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, another battle royale styled shooter you say? And It’s early access to boot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How bout nah fam…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll stick to playing Overwatch while I watch this hype train crash and burn like it always does…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t. The train went off the rails and kept rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this November, the game has reached unprecedented success, reaching 2 million sales in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the deal then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance the game is relatively standard fare when it comes to its genre. The games mechanics are inspired by numerous Arma knockoffs and other predecessors of its kind. You have your fair share of generic weapons, each lending themselves to a variety of tactical gameplay styles. You have your armor and health items which are important for late game survivability, and equipment like weapons optics and grips that increase your effectiveness with your tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this game does well is refining each of these elements, and funneling them into the gameplay. In past games of this type, I have found myself scrambling for the best loot only to find myself sprinting long distance across the map and getting my dome cracked by someone a quarter mile away hiding in a sniper’s nest. While this still does happen to some extent, the game does its best to remove some of the tediousness that comes with this early stage in the game by offering loot in large supply, as well as easily accessible transportation that gives the New York sub system a run for its money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these refined gameplay mechanics lock into a high intensity gameplay experience. One moment you are searching through a small town, desperately seeking medical supplies for your injured teammate, only to find yourself under fire from every direction, scrambling for cover and a firing solution. It’s these blood rushing variable moments that really separates PUBG from its competition, giving it a unique gameplay that only expands with the ungodly amounts of time you’ll put into it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">“I’ve got eyes… four hundred meters North West bearing on my three forty-five…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Mamuro Oshii Tells a Story Through Space</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/scene.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Mamuro Oshii Tells a Story Through Space " /><published>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/scene</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/scene.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ARTLckN9e7I&quot;&gt;Link to Scene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mamuro Oshii’s classic 1995 Ghost in the Shell is one of my most favorite films. Not only is it considered to be one of the greatest anime films of all time, but it also served to be the next step in the evolution of the science fiction film genre. There is so much that I can say about this masterpiece, but for right now, I am going to focus on one of its aspects that are often overlooked by both filmmakers and audiences alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I have always appreciated about Mamuro Oshii is his brilliant use of setpieces to convey emotions and themes. There is a three and a half minute segment in Ghost in The Shell that shows just how effective he is at achieving this. However, before I dive into this, it is important to have an understanding of the film’s philosophy and setting to be able to fully appreciate Oshii’s direction.
Ghost in the Shell follows Motoko Kusanagi, a fully cyber-augmented field officer, and her unit part of a public-security division known as Section 9. Throughout the film, Motoko undergoes a search for her own identity, often times questioning her own humanity. This is the films inherent theme. The “Ghost in the Shell” referring to the separation of the mind in a physical body. In this three and a half minute scene, Oshii captures Motoko’s internal dilemma externally through her surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start, we immediately open on Motoko staring blankly ahead as she rides a boat through the city. Eventually, she turns to face the camera, initiating the sequence that reflects the thoughts. Kenji Kawai’s Japanese choir sounds as a plane flies over a city very clearly modeled after Hong Kong. The plane itself takes on a very naturally avian design, almost completely birdlike. This is emphasized even more so in its reflection in the windows of a building. It’s silhouette bending and warping to give its wings a featherlike motion. Yet while it retains a naturalistic design, it is still a fully artificial product of manufacturing. The plane reflects Motoko and her world. A world that has blurred the lines between what is natural or artificial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/oshii-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the boat continues, we begin to see more of the city for ourselves. A dark and dreary color palette fills the screen in the form of a maze of distressed buildings, occupied by a sea of seemingly lifeless inhabitants. As Motoko passes a building, she sees a woman in a cafe window. This woman appears to be the same exact model as Motoko. They maintain eye contact for some time until Motoko looks again forward towards the city as if to question the difference between the artificial structure of the city and herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/oshii-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are then shown garbage floating in the water, mechanical relics of past years. This image subsequently follows her encounter with the woman in the window, suggesting that Motoko is questioning her individuality. Is there anything humanly unique about her? Is she just another production model to be thrown away when she is no longer of use? This question is then extended to the general population, as we see peoples reflections among mannequins in store windows. The mannequins are nearly identical to the people walking by blurring any distinction between what is truly human. Motoko also once again sees another model of herself in the store window, serving as another reflection. It is all of these repetitive symbols that capture the essence of Motoko’s struggle and the overarching theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motoko being almost fully machine is unable to properly display her emotions, not knowing what it is like to feel like a human being. So instead, the city weeps for her as the rain begins pouring down. While raining we are taken through more shots of the city, being able to see the old buildings reminiscent of Kowloon contrasting with the silver megastructures that make up the new city. We see children running through the rain, representing the city’s small human essence that it clutches onto, overshadowed by the giant industrial structures. This symbolism repeated in images of humans contrasting with their environment, showing the conflict between machine and humanity. Not a blaring conflict with guns and bullets, but a gradual whimpering. A cold mechanical coma. Motoko searching for a meaning lost in a cycle of technology and time. Like tears in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost in The Shell is a work characterized by its profound subject matter and themes. However, it is only through Oshii’s direction that this film is able to have its intended effect. Oshii adds a visual element to the story not just to fulfill establishing shots or transitions, but to drive home the emotion that is being carried throughout the story. He proves one thing about the environment around you. You can ask a question without speaking, and if you listen for long enough, the world will answer for itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Link to Scene</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Come on and Slam</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/come-on-and-slam.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Come on and Slam" /><published>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/come-on-and-slam</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/come-on-and-slam.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll be the first to say it. Poetry slams aren’t my cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from an arts magnet school, my idea of a poetry slam spawns itself as a gaggle of angsty teen tumblrites plaintively crying “no one understands me”. With a few exceptions from genuinely talented writers, this was what I actually experienced from my high school student poetry exhibitions. So, when I heard of this event, I naturally wasn’t too enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was like an aloof traveler unwittingly stepping into a dragon’s lair. I say that because I was genuinely surprised by what I would witness. Each poet unleashed a verbal barrage after verbal barrage, each individually loaded with wit, humor, and visceral description. It was chilling at first, hearing skilled writers perform like this. But as they continued, I gradually warmed up. I was enjoying it all. I even found myself shouting with them. They were straight up spitting fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all of the poems I heard there was one that really caught my attention. It was one in which the poet Vanessa discussed her identity as an Afro-Latina, and how it plays a part in her life. She talked about how she struggled to find her identity in a world that throws out any sense of cultural nuance, always labeling her and forcing her to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Puerto Rican who grew up in a predominantly white town I really feel this sentiment. I’ve often been called “gringito” for the way I speak, and never can truly feel like I am a part of my own culture. I was also never able to feel truly comfortably among a sea of white. While I found my place growing up in this small Italian run town, I always felt different because of the color of my skin. Never Rican enough, and never white enough. That’s how it was, and still is for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to this event gave me a lot of perspective, both within poetry and the topics that were brought up. I discovered a lot about the poet’s lives, and discovered a lot about myself as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ll be the first to say it.

Shoulder to shoulder a sea of business casual (and occasional “casual-casual”) sits huddled outside the Stamford metro station, anxiously waiting for their cue while trying to stay warm in the brisk November air. The walk signal appears, and among the rest of the bodies I begin my journey downtown walking through the sleek wiggling curvatures of the UBS building’s exterior.  However cold the air is it doesn’t take long for the bodies to disperse, each going to their respective places of work. By the time I’m halfway through the park the suits in front of me are gone, and I am left without meat shields to absorb the wind tunnel that is Washington Blvd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I see them. The buildings that the coastlines financial buildings try so desperately to hide from passersby on the 95. The cylindrical buildings stand tall but not so proud, triangulated in array of dilapidated exteriors. Everything is a discolored grey now, if there even is such a thing. It’s not even cloudy outside. Hell, its bright as day could ever be given today’s climate. But with these buildings everything seems grey. The scene feels straight out of a dystopian future noir. The huge monolithic corporations to my back as I walk face buried in my jacket among a cast of downtrodden characters played in part by the buildings’ residents. Their faces bearing the personality of the buildings they inhabit as they wait for their morning bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/towers-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God these buildings are ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet I still hold a sentiment towards them. The reason being a small detail that few fail to notice walking by these buildings. A painting sitting in a windowsill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/towers-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see these buildings for what they are… I see them for what they could have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of their completion in 1971, these buildings were considered to be futuristic, bearing a utopic element of design in a city dominated by brownstone buildings and industrial warehouses. The concept imagined residences surrounded by free form highline parks for residents to explore, complete with lush green grass patches, ponds, and recreational areas. These buildings were the embodiment of a Utopian values both in design aesthetic and lifestyle that today’s smart cities still fail to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where did it go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I sadly can’t say for certain. All I know is that the buildings did (at least to some extent) realize some of its concepts. Here in an image taken from a bird’s eye view you can see the highline still bears what resembles a basketball court, just like the one you can vaguely see in the concept art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/towers-3.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right; max-width: 250px; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the buildings became home to many immigrant residents moving into Stamford, and that it still today provides an affordable housing option to these families. What is an eyesore for the city is one of the few last remaining downtown structures that allows lower income families to have access to this part of Stamford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in this sense that the buildings still stand for something. They still carry the idea that everyone can be part of a city’s growth. But this idea, like the buildings themselves, is crumbling away in favor of a more gilded city image. While digging up some information on the buildings, I came on a series of city development forums from 2007 which all point to a fundamental problem in the city’s urban development, and urban development across the country. Lack of affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the inner demolition to one of the buildings has already occurred. These plans were referred to on the forums. Their replacement? Luxury condos.
This is where the Utopian dream becomes deferred.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The morning light crests over the horizon, revealing its full radiance upon the Stamford skyline.

&lt;p&gt;In a dark age of stale reboots leeching off of an ever so present nostalgia for the 80’s, Blade Runner 2049 dares to break through the bulwark of a tired out genre. Denis Villeneuve and his ambitious team manage to deliver one of the most intensely philosophical science fiction films in decades, never holding your hand as the dark black spiral spins you into the deepest existential window of the human soul. It asks the questions that we are afraid to ask ourselves, mirroring our human vulnerabilities within brilliantly introspective characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title ever so subtly alludes to, the year is 2049 AD. Almost twenty years after the original films events took place. Older models of Replicants (synthetic humans intended to be used for labor) have since been discontinued, replaced by newer models built by the Wallace corporation. Blade Runners are tasked with “retiring” any older models that continue to live on past their programmed lifespan. Our story opens on our resident Blade Runner, Officer K (Ryan Gosling) on his way to retire a suspected replicant (played in a stunning performance by Dave Bautista). What he finds however sends Officer K on a trail to uncover the mystery and meaning of his past, the other replicants, and the essence of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, the visuals in this film are masterful works of art. Every frame could in itself be its very own masterpiece. Los Angeles in 2049 is cast with shadowed hues, illuminated only by incredibly rendered holographic projections. And while the films visuals support the cold lifeless themes that populate the dark and moody future that is 2049, I often found beautiful contrasts between organic and synthetic. Waves crashing against mountainous sea walls, rain pattering down between monolithic megastructures, and pale white snow purifying the greyed out earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound design and music however is no second contender to the visual spectacle. Benjamin Wallfisch and Hanz Zimmer deliver a gorgeously composed soundtrack that manages to capture the essence Vangelis’ score for the original Blade Runner and are brimming with the familiar sounds that fans of the universe needed to hear. It’s bolder, louder, and darker with Hans Zimmer’s signature blaring bass tones and Benjamin Wallfisch’s artfully crafted synth layers forming a digital storm that manages to carry the tone of the film all the way through. The fruits of their collaborative work can be told in one stroke through listening to the track “Sea Wall” which provides a cinematic aural experience for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally as impressive as the films production is its direction and casting. Not one moment went by where I felt a character off their mark. There were moments that I was so surprised by attention to detail and subtlety that I would otherwise forget that the characters on screen were acting. Small things like Officer K’s interaction with the code machine at the police station when trying to find a genetic match for a lead. The hesitation in reaching for the lever, then looking back down at the keypad to type in the last few adjustments before reaching for the lever again. It makes sense for a character who isn’t wholly familiar with a device and helps further immerse an audience seeing subtle imperfections in the character interactions with their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ana De Armas brought a brilliant character to life through her role as Joi, a virtual companion to Officer K who takes the form of a hologram. Her relationship with Officer K brings a genuine humanity to the film, questioning whether two soulless beings can be more real than their human counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blade Runner 2049 could have easily been another Hollywood reboot. It was a movie that had the potential to be steered in the direction of summer blockbusters, sucked dry of any intrinsic intellectual value by the popular masses feeding from action thriller to action thriller. But it didn’t. It was much more than I could have asked it to be as a sequel. In my eyes it manages to meet its predecessor and go above and beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blade Runner 2049 is meditative, visually stunning, and everything I could have dreamed of. It manages to ask timeless questions and enriches the viewers mind with complex and existential themes that will be sure to make them question what it really means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">“Blade Runner 2049 is meditative, visually stunning, and everything I could have dreamed of.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Death Grips My Tongue’s Tip</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/death-grips.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Death Grips My Tongue's Tip" /><published>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/death-grips</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/death-grips.html">&lt;p&gt;And I can’t stop listening to them…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months ago, I was experiencing my annual musical exploration kick. I liken it to a weekend rum tasting of sorts. A collection of the finest aural flavors I could crowdsource and research in a week’s time, lined up in neat rows ready to be savored and critiqued. This year’s tasting was a little underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just recently come off of the Doom 2016 Video Game Soundtrack composed by Mick Gordon. Its impressive blend of heavy multi-processed analog synth tones and down-tuned guitar riffs. I was still craving something heavy hitting, unique, and genre-breaking as Mick’s soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already drunk a glass of Bacardi beforehand, and now all I wanted to do was get lit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about to give up and just down the rest of the bottle, a decision that most binge drinkers regret when they’re leaned over the toilet extruding their insides at projectile velocity.
(Drink responsibly kids.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was when my friend approached me with a late recommendation. A bottle labeled Death Grips: Bottomless Pit. He approached me and said, “Yo you gotta listen to these guys, like they’re maaaad crazy but it’s something that you would probably into”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maaaaaad crazy huh? I liked the sound of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I said, “Eh, sure I’ll have a listen”. I plugged in and strapped down, ready to experience this mad crazy for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Mick Gordon’s Doom soundtrack was a glass of Bacardi, Death Grips was an oddly mixed Molotov cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are new to this banger of a party, Death Grips is a Sacramento based experimental hip-hop trio, featuring rapper/vocalist MC Ride, Zach Hill on drums, and Andy Morin on production and bass guitar. They’re most known for their unconventional musical style and genre-bending tracks that have been influential in steering the direction of modern hip-hop. MC Rides aggressive vocal delivery accentuates the group’s raw energy both in the studio and on stage, and in my opinion, serves to be the most important ingredient to this hell of a concoction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first track that I had the pleasure of listening to was Death Grips’ “Hot head”. The track opened up with some arpeggiated analog style synths. Not a bad start to a track. I tend to enjoy synthesizers, and it had been a while since I heard any kind of rap or hip-hop with electronic influences. I wasn’t ready for what I was about to hear next. I was met with a violent bombardment of downsampled percussion and incoherent gibberish. A few seconds later and the bombardment intensified. It sounded like a group of metal, free jazz, and punk drummers decided to have a musical orgy, and the gibberish now sounded more akin to a dog barking into a microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWB23fHSBxU&amp;amp;list=PL3fa2n-Fi00c9-8vuC378xm6vqrjRiqn6&amp;amp;index=2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ears were asking me “lol wtf is this, unplug please”. I ended up going home and listening to more of their material. To my confusion, there happened to be a significant cult fan-base following them. At first, I thought they were just a meme circulated by music forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while to get adjusted to the new sound. But after a few listens over their work I began discovering the actual appeal behind Death Grips, and actually began to enjoy their tracks. I began loving every crazy second of it that I heard and even found meaning in their music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be found on tracks like “I’ve Seen Footage”, in which MC Ride talks about how he has not only become desensitized by his past trauma but also as a result of the mass amounts of disturbing media online. I find this track meaning to be extremely culturally relevant, considering that the topic of trauma has been overlooked when it comes to media. I myself have found myself witness to traumatizing events right in front of me, and not batting an eye due to the imagery I have experienced second hand. This same type of unfiltered substance can be found in many other tracks as well, offering not just a unique sound to their artistry, but bold commentary as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death Grips has become one of my favorite listens of all time, offering a unique flavor of artistry through their performance, musical sound, and lyricism. It isn’t often that I go for second or third rounds, so I definitely would recommend giving them a taste. Who knows, maybe you’ll find that Death Grips your tongue too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">And I can’t stop listening to them…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Healthcare</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/healthcare.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Healthcare" /><published>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-05T12:44:06-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/healthcare</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/12/05/healthcare.html">&lt;p&gt;Aint healthcare a bitch?

&lt;p&gt;RE: Is Health Care A Right? By: Atul Gawande&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year is 1978. It’s a new age of terror and warfare that requires a new breed of badass willing to go step over the line. Meet Tom Cruise. A man who is willing to go to every extent to save his acting career from obscurity. Played by the man himself Tom Cruise. When Tom Cruise is met by a secret casting agent to do some cool acting stuff, he is faced with the ride of his life. And you better bet your bottom dollar that he’s there to kick some ass and chew bubblegum, but he’s all out of gum… Implying that he’s only there to kick some ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously though. Before this article, I didn’t expect to see much from a supposedly “historical” blockbuster. A thriller inspired by the C.I.A drug running brush wars in the 80’s? Starring Tom Cruise? Yeah, I’ll pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, sure it isn’t gonna be accurate. Sure, it’s not going to hit those points that it should. Otherwise we would be watching a history channel doc. (And we know where they’ve been headed for a while.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s Hollywood, what can you expect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly I’m just surprised that they went as far as to ruin Tom’s shit eating grin on screen! Honestly, from the title, I thought this article that this movie was going to be garbage. But towards the end of it, it’s kind of relieving to see that at least some historical semblance is shown in the flick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was kind of on the fence about watching this movie. But now I’m actually curious to see some of the redeeming points mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dig into that shit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jokingly, captain obvious goal of cooking yourself a meal from my classmate Gabriel Ortiz. And as I questioned him about fashioning stove top consumables, I couldn’t help but parallel Gabe’s chef-like-qualities to the essential skills of leading a coherent life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I do all my choppin’, set the plates.” Mapping the Rachel Ray road to successful thirty-minute meals that makes watching episodes of Stranger Things seem affordable while balancing college credit contingency—a trench warfare I fight in finding time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I try to time things out,” he said, employing the hamster-minded-wheels, imagining himself in the apron jockeying pots and pans. “I finish one task while moving to another,” he exerted. And whether I’m catching a train or catching up with film review revisions, I’m always trying to catch the ball that’s rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabe says with a smile, “I clean as I go, it just makes things easier.” And I thought, no sense in trippin’ on your own feet, especially when they’re the ones that got you there. If I didn’t clean up after myself physically and mentally, I’d be living a messy life full of obstacles that I created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I should do is take Gabe’s (whether he was giving or not) advice, and live in his would of kitchen etiquette: where if you pay the always moving hands, ready the table, and have a rag to spare, you can “Dig into that shit.” Dig into life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
