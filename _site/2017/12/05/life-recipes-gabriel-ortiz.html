<p>“Dig into that shit.”</p>

<p>The jokingly, captain obvious goal of cooking yourself a meal from my classmate Gabriel Ortiz. And as I questioned him about fashioning stove top consumables, I couldn’t help but parallel Gabe’s chef-like-qualities to the essential skills of leading a coherent life.</p>

<p>“I do all my choppin’, set the plates.” Mapping the Rachel Ray road to successful thirty-minute meals that makes watching episodes of Stranger Things seem affordable while balancing college credit contingency—a trench warfare I fight in finding time.</p>

<p>“I try to time things out,” he said, employing the hamster-minded-wheels, imagining himself in the apron jockeying pots and pans. “I finish one task while moving to another,” he exerted. And whether I’m catching a train or catching up with film review revisions, I’m always trying to catch the ball that’s rolling.</p>

<p>Gabe says with a smile, “I clean as I go, it just makes things easier.” And I thought, no sense in trippin’ on your own feet, especially when they’re the ones that got you there. If I didn’t clean up after myself physically and mentally, I’d be living a messy life full of obstacles that I created.</p>

<p>So what I should do is take Gabe’s (whether he was giving or not) advice, and live in his would of kitchen etiquette: where if you pay the always moving hands, ready the table, and have a rag to spare, you can “Dig into that shit.” Dig into life.</p>
