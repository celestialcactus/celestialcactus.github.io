    <p>“Blade Runner 2049 is meditative, visually stunning, and everything I could have dreamed of.”</p>

<p>In a dark age of stale reboots leeching off of an ever so present nostalgia for the 80’s, Blade Runner 2049 dares to break through the bulwark of a tired out genre. Denis Villeneuve and his ambitious team manage to deliver one of the most intensely philosophical science fiction films in decades, never holding your hand as the dark black spiral spins you into the deepest existential window of the human soul. It asks the questions that we are afraid to ask ourselves, mirroring our human vulnerabilities within brilliantly introspective characters.</p>

<p>As the title ever so subtly alludes to, the year is 2049 AD. Almost twenty years after the original films events took place. Older models of Replicants (synthetic humans intended to be used for labor) have since been discontinued, replaced by newer models built by the Wallace corporation. Blade Runners are tasked with “retiring” any older models that continue to live on past their programmed lifespan. Our story opens on our resident Blade Runner, Officer K (Ryan Gosling) on his way to retire a suspected replicant (played in a stunning performance by Dave Bautista). What he finds however sends Officer K on a trail to uncover the mystery and meaning of his past, the other replicants, and the essence of humanity.</p>

<p>As previously noted, the visuals in this film are masterful works of art. Every frame could in itself be its very own masterpiece. Los Angeles in 2049 is cast with shadowed hues, illuminated only by incredibly rendered holographic projections. And while the films visuals support the cold lifeless themes that populate the dark and moody future that is 2049, I often found beautiful contrasts between organic and synthetic. Waves crashing against mountainous sea walls, rain pattering down between monolithic megastructures, and pale white snow purifying the greyed out earth.</p>

<p>The sound design and music however is no second contender to the visual spectacle. Benjamin Wallfisch and Hanz Zimmer deliver a gorgeously composed soundtrack that manages to capture the essence Vangelis’ score for the original Blade Runner and are brimming with the familiar sounds that fans of the universe needed to hear. It’s bolder, louder, and darker with Hans Zimmer’s signature blaring bass tones and Benjamin Wallfisch’s artfully crafted synth layers forming a digital storm that manages to carry the tone of the film all the way through. The fruits of their collaborative work can be told in one stroke through listening to the track “Sea Wall” which provides a cinematic aural experience for the ages.</p>

<p>Equally as impressive as the films production is its direction and casting. Not one moment went by where I felt a character off their mark. There were moments that I was so surprised by attention to detail and subtlety that I would otherwise forget that the characters on screen were acting. Small things like Officer K’s interaction with the code machine at the police station when trying to find a genetic match for a lead. The hesitation in reaching for the lever, then looking back down at the keypad to type in the last few adjustments before reaching for the lever again. It makes sense for a character who isn’t wholly familiar with a device and helps further immerse an audience seeing subtle imperfections in the character interactions with their world.</p>

<p>Ana De Armas brought a brilliant character to life through her role as Joi, a virtual companion to Officer K who takes the form of a hologram. Her relationship with Officer K brings a genuine humanity to the film, questioning whether two soulless beings can be more real than their human counterparts.</p>

<p>Blade Runner 2049 could have easily been another Hollywood reboot. It was a movie that had the potential to be steered in the direction of summer blockbusters, sucked dry of any intrinsic intellectual value by the popular masses feeding from action thriller to action thriller. But it didn’t. It was much more than I could have asked it to be as a sequel. In my eyes it manages to meet its predecessor and go above and beyond it.</p>

<p>Blade Runner 2049 is meditative, visually stunning, and everything I could have dreamed of. It manages to ask timeless questions and enriches the viewers mind with complex and existential themes that will be sure to make them question what it really means to be human.</p>
