            <h1>Come on and Slam</h1>
            <p><b>Dec 5, 2017</b></p>
            <p>I’ll be the first to say it. Poetry slams aren’t my cup of tea.</p>

<p>Coming from an arts magnet school, my idea of a poetry slam spawns itself as a gaggle of angsty teen tumblrites plaintively crying “no one understands me”. With a few exceptions from genuinely talented writers, this was what I actually experienced from my high school student poetry exhibitions. So, when I heard of this event, I naturally wasn’t too enthusiastic.</p>

<p>I was like an aloof traveler unwittingly stepping into a dragon’s lair. I say that because I was genuinely surprised by what I would witness. Each poet unleashed a verbal barrage after verbal barrage, each individually loaded with wit, humor, and visceral description. It was chilling at first, hearing skilled writers perform like this. But as they continued, I gradually warmed up. I was enjoying it all. I even found myself shouting with them. They were straight up spitting fire.</p>

<p>Of all of the poems I heard there was one that really caught my attention. It was one in which the poet Vanessa discussed her identity as an Afro-Latina, and how it plays a part in her life. She talked about how she struggled to find her identity in a world that throws out any sense of cultural nuance, always labeling her and forcing her to choose.</p>

<p>As a Puerto Rican who grew up in a predominantly white town I really feel this sentiment. I’ve often been called “gringito” for the way I speak, and never can truly feel like I am a part of my own culture. I was also never able to feel truly comfortably among a sea of white. While I found my place growing up in this small Italian run town, I always felt different because of the color of my skin. Never Rican enough, and never white enough. That’s how it was, and still is for me.</p>

<p>Going to this event gave me a lot of perspective, both within poetry and the topics that were brought up. I discovered a lot about the poet’s lives, and discovered a lot about myself as well.</p>
