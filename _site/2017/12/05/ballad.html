    <p>The morning light crests over the horizon, revealing its full radiance upon the Stamford skyline. Shoulder to shoulder a sea of business casual (and occasional “casual-casual”) sits huddled outside the Stamford metro station, anxiously waiting for their cue while trying to stay warm in the brisk November air. The walk signal appears, and among the rest of the bodies I begin my journey downtown walking through the sleek wiggling curvatures of the UBS building’s exterior.  However cold the air is it doesn’t take long for the bodies to disperse, each going to their respective places of work. By the time I’m halfway through the park the suits in front of me are gone, and I am left without meat shields to absorb the wind tunnel that is Washington Blvd.</p>

<p>That’s when I see them. The buildings that the coastlines financial buildings try so desperately to hide from passersby on the 95. The cylindrical buildings stand tall but not so proud, triangulated in array of dilapidated exteriors. Everything is a discolored grey now, if there even is such a thing. It’s not even cloudy outside. Hell, its bright as day could ever be given today’s climate. But with these buildings everything seems grey. The scene feels straight out of a dystopian future noir. The huge monolithic corporations to my back as I walk face buried in my jacket among a cast of downtrodden characters played in part by the buildings’ residents. Their faces bearing the personality of the buildings they inhabit as they wait for their morning bus.</p>

<p>God these buildings are ugly.</p>

<p>Yet I still hold a sentiment towards them. The reason being a small detail that few fail to notice walking by these buildings. A painting sitting in a windowsill.</p>

<p>I don’t see these buildings for what they are… I see them for what they could have been.</p>

<p>At the time of their completion in 1971, these buildings were considered to be futuristic, bearing a utopic element of design in a city dominated by brownstone buildings and industrial warehouses. The concept imagined residences surrounded by free form highline parks for residents to explore, complete with lush green grass patches, ponds, and recreational areas. These buildings were the embodiment of a Utopian values both in design aesthetic and lifestyle that today’s smart cities still fail to create.</p>

<p>So where did it go wrong?</p>

<p>This I sadly can’t say for certain. All I know is that the buildings did (at least to some extent) realize some of its concepts. Here in an image taken from a bird’s eye view you can see the highline still bears what resembles a basketball court, just like the one you can vaguely see in the concept art.</p>

<p>In addition, the buildings became home to many immigrant residents moving into Stamford, and that it still today provides an affordable housing option to these families. What is an eyesore for the city is one of the few last remaining downtown structures that allows lower income families to have access to this part of Stamford.</p>

<p>It is in this sense that the buildings still stand for something. They still carry the idea that everyone can be part of a city’s growth. But this idea, like the buildings themselves, is crumbling away in favor of a more gilded city image. While digging up some information on the buildings, I came on a series of city development forums from 2007 which all point to a fundamental problem in the city’s urban development, and urban development across the country. Lack of affordable housing.</p>

<p>In addition, the inner demolition to one of the buildings has already occurred. These plans were referred to on the forums. Their replacement? Luxury condos.
This is where the Utopian dream becomes deferred.</p>
