A sheet of blue haze masks narrow city streets, pierced only by incandescent holographic projections. The cacophony of synthetic colorful sounds fades as I emerge from a virtual arcade. A place where I am allowed to fail. It’s a distraction from a reality where the only alternative is public Japanese ritual suicide.

The rain hits me and washes away the criminal counterfeit that I call my digital self. It’s quiet again. The world sleeps silently as the machines sing their songs and I listen, walking among them in awe of their sense of purpose.

I kind of envy them. They don’t panic. They don’t feel pain. And when they fail, it was only because of their programming.

And here I stand among them... my withering body fueled only by alcohol, painkillers, and methamphetamines.

Philosophical themes and machine dreams.
Music, Art, Film, and God knows what else what.

Welcome to my world….

<!-- Hey, I’m Gabe. I make music, videos, and have an unhealthy relationship with technology. Like a lot of people my age, I worry a lot. Some people worry about their exams or whether they’ll be able to crawl out of crippling debt. I worry about whether or not the next anime adaptation will be garbage. I worry about if I’ll still have a job when robots finally develop a creative conscience. And I also worry about whether or not I’ll be able to visit Japan before North Korea turns it into a Mad Max esque radioactive wasteland.

Come along for the ride into the digital abyss. -->
