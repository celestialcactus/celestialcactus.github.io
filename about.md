A sheet of blue haze masks narrow city streets, pierced only by incandescent holographic projections. The cacophony of synthetic colorful sounds fades as I emerge from a mirrored reality. A digital world where I lose myself. 

It’s quiet again. The world sleeps silently as the machines sing their songs and I listen, walking among them in awe of their sense of purpose.

Do they dream of electric sheep?

We may never know, but I’ll always be asking the serious questions around here while we lie in wait for the singularity hoping one day to ask them myself.  

Philosophical themes and machine dreams. Music, Art, and Film.
 
Welcome to my world….
