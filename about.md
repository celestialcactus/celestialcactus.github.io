A sheet of blue haze masks narrow city streets, pierced only by incandescent holographic projections. The cacophony of synthetic colorful sounds fades as I emerge from a virtual arcade. A place where I am allowed to fail. It’s a distraction from a reality where the only alternative is public Japanese ritual suicide.

The rain hits me and washes away the criminal counterfeit that I call my digital self. It’s quiet again. The world sleeps silently as the machines sing their songs and I listen, walking among them in awe of their sense of purpose.

I kind of envy them. They don’t panic. They don’t feel pain. And when they fail, it was only because of their programming.

And here I stand among them... my withering body fueled only by alcohol, painkillers, and methamphetamines.

Philosophical themes and machine dreams.
Music, Art, Film, and God knows what else what.

Welcome to my world….
